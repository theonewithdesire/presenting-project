# Cookie Store Full‑Stack – Technical Presentation

A simple, single‑page presentation that visually explains the architecture of a hypothetical e‑commerce app ("Cookie Store"). It showcases frontend, backend, and full‑stack concepts using a clean, animated UI. This is not a running full‑stack app; it's a static site for technical presentation.

## Quick Start

- Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or
- Serve locally for best results:
  - Python: `python3 -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000`
  - Node: `npx serve` then open the printed URL

## What You’ll See

- Loading screen with a brief "analysis" animation
- Hero section with code tabs and animated stats
- Frontend, Backend, and Full‑Stack overview sections
- Smooth scrolling navigation and subtle reveal animations

## Tech Used (for this page)

- Plain `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`
- Google Fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono)
- No build tools or dependencies required

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Page markup and presentation content
- `styles.css` – Minimal black & white theme, layout, and animations
- `script.js` – UI interactions (typing effect, tabs, counters, reveals)

## Customize

- Numbers/text: edit sections in `index.html` (e.g., stats and labels)
- Code tabs: update the `codeSamples` object in `script.js`
- Theme: tweak CSS variables in `:root` inside `styles.css`
